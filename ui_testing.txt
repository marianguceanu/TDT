User Interface Testing. Definition
• User Interface Testing checks if the UI elements have been implemented correctly.
• User interface testing is NOT about:
• whether the UI is well designed or
• easy to understand or
• easy to work with.
• All from above are aspects related to usability testing.
Coverage: user interface testing covers all the elements of the user interface
(the dialogs, menus, pull-down lists, and all the other UI controls)
